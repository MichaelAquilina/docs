# Challenge types

**1.**      **Tutorial** \(created in TFW\): the user is guided through the challenge, supported with hints and other ways sed on the comprehensive messaging system of the TFW. This is the most frequently used type on the Avatao platform now. See example on the platform: [Unsafe use of Reflection: Animal Fan Site](https://platform.avatao.com/challenges/aabad73c-6eb0-4bd2-b7aa-ac351ad0ab96).

**2.**      **Attack**: the user have to capture the flag. This challenge type has a less complicated file structure. On the platform there is a box where the flag should be written to check the solution. Example: [Direct object reference](https://platform.avatao.com/challenges/c51b9e30-773d-4987-87a9-48483e9fd3df).

**3.**      **Fixing**: the user has to complete a code here. At the beginnings these challenges were written by **Codiac** framework, but we do our best to recreate them in TFW as soon as possible. Examples: [Fix insecure direct object reference \(with Codiad\)](https://platform.avatao.com/challenges/7184be09-e318-4baf-b29a-432974ea9a6b), [Fix Direct Object Reference with Spring AOP \(with TFW\)](https://platform.avatao.com/challenges/157fcb51-496e-47b1-9908-335b7a16c606).

**4.**      **Assessment**: we are planning to introduce a new challenge type in the near future that is for estimating the skills and basic knowledge of a user in different areas of IT security. The challenge will contain about ten questions with a time limit at each level.
