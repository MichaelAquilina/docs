# Introduction

This document mainly aims to basic principles and best practices of challange creating respectively focusing to the Tutorial Framework \(TFW\) what is tool for make easier content developers’s work in creating interactive tutorials for the Avatao platform.

TFW consists of three repositories\[1\]. Please check these repos and read their **documentations** \(README.md\), too! \(However, this document contains the more important parts of these repos documentations.\)

\*\*\*\*[**Baseimage Tutorial Framework**](https://github.com/avatao-content/baseimage-tutorial-framework)\*\*\*\*

To learn the stuff you need to know about TFW in order to get started you should consult this repo first. This is the beating heart of TFW – the Docker baseimage containing the internals of the framework.

\*\*\*\*[**Test Tutorial Framework**](https://github.com/avatao-content/test-tutorial-framework)\*\*\*\*

This is an example playground project built via TFW. It is a good starting point to build your own challenges from and will host automated tests in the future.

\*\*\*\*[**Frontend Tutorial Framework**](https://github.com/avatao-content/frontend-tutorial-framework)\*\*\*\*

This is the Angular frontend of the TFW.

Note that before getting started with TFW you should already know how to create simpler Avatao challenges. To learn about Avatao challenge creation in general please check the [challenge-toolbox](https://github.com/avatao-content/challenge-toolbox) repository what is toolbox is a small component which allows you to create, run and check new Avatao challenges locally:

\*\*\*\*[**Challenge Toolbox**](https://github.com/avatao-content/challenge-toolbox)\*\*\*\*

All the repos mentioned above will be automatically cloned to the tools directory in the Desktop after running the install script \(see later\).
