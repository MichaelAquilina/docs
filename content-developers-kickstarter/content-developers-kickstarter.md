# Introduction

This document aims to lay down the basic principles and best practices of challenge creation, specifically focusing on the Tutorial Framework \(TFW\), a tool intended to make developers’ work easier in terms of creating interactive tutorials for the Avatao platform.

TFW consists of three repositories\[1\]. Please check these repos and read their **documentations** \(README.md\), too! \(However, this document contains the most important parts of these repos documentations.\)

\*\*\*\*[**Baseimage Tutorial Framework**](https://github.com/avatao-content/baseimage-tutorial-framework)\*\*\*\*

Before you get started and in order to see what you need to know about TFW, you should consult the repo first. This is the heart of TWF - the Docker baseimage contains the internal of the framework.

\*\*\*\*[**Test Tutorial Framework**](https://github.com/avatao-content/test-tutorial-framework)\*\*\*\*

This is an example playground project built via TFW. It’s a good starting point to build your own challenges from, and will host automated tests in the future.

\*\*\*\*[**Frontend Tutorial Framework**](https://github.com/avatao-content/frontend-tutorial-framework)\*\*\*\*

This is the Angular frontend of the TFW.

Note that before getting started with TFW you should already know how to create simpler Avatao challenges. To learn about Avatao challenge creation in general, please check the[ challenge-toolbox](https://github.com/avatao-content/challenge-toolbox) repository. A toolbox is a small component which allows you to create, run and check new Avatao challenges locally:

All the repos mentioned above will be automatically cloned to the tools directory in the Desktop after running the install script \(see later\).
